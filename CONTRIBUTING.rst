Reporting A Bug/Feature
=======================

The Github issue tracker is the preffered channel for reporting bugs and requesting new features for each library. Please search the existing issues to ensure we do not have duplicates. If you find an issue that covers your suggestion then please add a +1 to the existing post. Otherwise, add the issue using either of the templates we have uploaded.
